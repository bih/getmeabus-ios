# GetMeABus.com

GetMeABus is a simple website developed by [Danny Wilson](http://danwilson.co) and [Syeef Karim](http://syeefkarim.com).
Finding out bus times is a horrible and boring task, not made easy by the fact that the information can be difficult to find and read.

GetMeABus works by finding your current location and then all the bus stops nearby. Once the user selects a bus stop the bus times are displayed in a list below.
If however the website is unable to find your current location or it finds the wrong location, the user can input their postcode and the website will proceed as normal.
